# Maven Airlines Passenger Satisfaction Analysis Project

## Project Objective

Passenger satisfaction is a crucial element for the success and reputation of any airline company. Recent survey results from Maven Airlines passengers have shown a satisfaction rate below 50% for the first time. The goal of this analysis is to identify key areas that require improvement and to recommend a data-driven strategy to increase the satisfaction rate.

## Methodology

To analyze the data, we will use various statistical and Machine Learning techniques. This may include descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, etc. Libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn will be employed to transform the data and produce relevant visualizations.


## Installation Instructions

The project is conducted using Python and requires the installation of the following packages :

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- plotly
- dash

These packages can be installed using pip :

```
